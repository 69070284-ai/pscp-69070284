# Problem Solving Submission

This file must be written by the student in their own words.

Use this template only for OJ problems that are marked as learning-log required.

Do not ask AI to write this file for you. AI may help check grammar, formatting, or clarity after you have written your own content.

If AI was used for this learning-log-required problem, also complete `ai_reflection.md`.

## 1. OJ Information

OJ problem number/title:

```text
OJ3115 - [LEARNING LOGS] Arcade of Time: Store Check
```

OJ submission ID, if submitted:

```text
632018
```

OJ status:

```text
Pass
```

Independent time spent on this problem:

```text
30-60 minutes
```

Choose one:

```text
0-15 minutes
15-30 minutes
30-60 minutes
1-3 hours
3-6 hours
6-24 hours
1-3 days
4-7 days
1-4 weeks
More than 4 weeks
```

How to count this time:

- Count only the time you actively worked on this problem independently.
- Start counting from when you first read the problem.
- Do not include breaks, meals, classes, sleep, time spent on other problems, or time when you were not working on this problem.
- If you used AI, count only the independent time before your first AI prompt.
- If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, count only the independent time before your first help request.
- If you used both AI and human help, count only the independent time before the first outside help of any kind.
- If you did not use AI or human help, count the time before writing this `submission.md`.
- An estimate is acceptable, but it must be honest.

## 2. My Understanding

Write the problem in your own words.

Also explain the input, output, and important constraints.

If you do not fully understand the problem yet, write what you currently understand. Your understanding may be incomplete or incorrect, but you must make a genuine attempt.

```text
Input:
n(int) and check(int)
+n line that have 2 integer in each one 
k*check integer in one line

Output:
k*check integer in one line that is processed

Constraints:
most io is in one line
time < 1441
```

## 3. My First Plan

Write your first plan before getting help from AI, a friend, a TA, an instructor, or before finalizing your code.

If you used AI, write the plan you had before your first AI prompt.

If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, write the plan you had before asking for help.

If you did not use AI or human help, write the plan you had before or while you started coding.

This can be rough. It may be incomplete or different from your final solution.

You may write pseudocode, a flowchart idea, or step-by-step thinking.

```text
Step 1 : receives the input use split and map to split and turn both into int
Step 2 : loop for range num
Step 3 : input in every loop 
Step 4 : appends it in lists
Step 5 : input for time to check and put it in a list
Step 6 : for loop to check if time to check is in range of open and close time of every stores
Step 7 : print it out
```

## 4. My Final Approach

Briefly explain the final algorithm or method you actually used in your submitted code.

This section is different from Section 3:

- Section 3 is your first plan before AI, human help, or before the final code.
- Section 4 is the final method used in your actual solution.
- If your final approach is the same as your first plan, write that it is the same and briefly explain why.

Do not copy AI's explanation.

Do not copy another person's explanation.

```text
almost the same as my first one i think
because the core idea is still there 
compare everything with list index
```

---

## 5. My Tests

Write at least 3 test cases that you tried or designed by yourself.

Try to choose test cases that are different from each other.

For each test case, explain why you chose it.

If the input or output has many lines, write them inside the text blocks.

### Test Case 1

Why I chose this case:

```text
Normal test case
```

Input:

```text
3 5
600 750
700 800
750 1000
600 700 800 100 750
```

Expected output:

```text
1 2 1 0 2
```

Actual output:

```text
1 2 1 0 2
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 2

Why I chose this case:

```text
smallest case
```

Input:

```text
1 1
1 2
1
```

Expected output:

```text
1
```

Actual output:

```text
1
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 3

Why I chose this case:

```text
Normal test case
```

Input:

```text
2 10
100 1000
100 500
100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000
```

Expected output:

```text
2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0
```

Actual output:

```text
2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

## 6. AI Use

Did you use AI for this problem?

```text
Yes
```

If yes, also complete:

```text
ai_reflection.md
```

If you only asked a friend, TA, or instructor and did not use AI, you do not need to complete `ai_reflection.md`.

```

If yes, briefly explain what kind of help you received.

Allowed examples:

- explanation of the problem statement
- explanation of a programming concept
- hint about the approach
- debugging discussion
- test-case discussion
- help understanding an error message

Not allowed:

- copying another person's code
